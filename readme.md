Schematic and PCB for my workbench light controller

The workbench light is a 1m strip of APA102C Cool White LEDs, 144 LEDS/m.

The controller is a custom PCB that uses capacitive touch buttons and is based on a PIC16F1719

The light housing is made from an aluminum commercial door threshold and some 3/8" black gas piping.

This is a work-in-progress with more information to come
